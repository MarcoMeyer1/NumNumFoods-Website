                <h2>Who are we?</h2>
                <p>Founded in 2019, Num Num Foods began as a passion project by a mother dedicated to creating healthy, nutritious, and delicious meals for young children. With her two young kids in mind, she envisioned providing fresh, homemade meals that could nurture and grow alongside her little ones. Every meal is crafted with love, designed to bring the goodness of home-cooked food from our kitchen to yours.</p>

                <h2>Why we do what we do</h2>
                <p>At Num Num Foods, we believe in simple, wholesome ingredients. Unlike other brands that rely on preservatives, added salt, or sugar, we’re committed to offering pure, natural meals that support baby-led weaning. Our meals allow babies to explore a variety of textures, encouraging crucial chewing abilities and promoting healthy facial muscle development—key for speech and growth. We aim to support parents by providing meal options they can trust for their children’s health and development.</p>

                <h2>How it works</h2>
                <p>
                    We offer a range of meal options that grow with your child, from 6-month pureed meals to textured meals for older babies, ensuring each stage offers new flavors and textures. Our meals are carefully crafted to provide an ideal balance of protein, starch, and vegetables, giving your baby the nourishment they need.

                    To retain freshness, all our meals are frozen and can be stored for up to six months. Each meal comes individually labeled, allowing you to try different flavors without waste or confusion. Plus, with no minimum order, you have the freedom to choose what works best for your family.
