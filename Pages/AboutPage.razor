                <h2>Who are we?</h2>
                <p>Num num was founded in 2019 by myself who was a mommy of a 2-year-old and a 3-month-old. I decided to start this company to provide delicious and nutritious meals that have been made with love from my kitchen to theirs.</p>

                <h2>Why we do what we do</h2>
                <p>
                    I knew that other brands out there contained far too many preservatives, so I decided to develop a range with no added preservatives, salt, or sugar. I also encourage baby-led weaning, so I introduced a baby-led weaning range. This range allows babies to explore texture and develop crucial chewing abilities.

                <p>
                    All my meals are carefully designed for a perfect protein, starch, and veg ratio to ensure your babies are receiving the best! All our meals are frozen to keep in all that goodness and can be stored for up to 6 months if stored correctly.
